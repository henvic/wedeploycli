 <h5 align="center">Functional tests for WeDeploy CLI using Expect/Tcl</h5>

## Dependencies
* Docker - to run infrastructure
* [Expect/Tcl](http://expect.sourceforge.net/)
* TclCurl package
    1. Install [ActiveTcl](https://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads)
    1. Clone [tclcurl-fa](https://github.com/flightaware/tclcurl-fa) and follow instructions to make and install
    1. Copy `tclcurl.tcl` from tclcurl-fa/generic to tclcurl-fa
    1. Place entire tclcurl-fa folder in `$auto_path`.  Check `$auto_path` by typing in the terminal:
        ```
        tclsh
        % puts $auto_path
        ```
    1. Confirm installation
        ```
        % package require TclCurl
        7.22.0
        ```

## Running tests
* [If running the infra locally](https://github.com/wedeploy/training#development), add these lines to /etc/hosts.
```
127.0.0.1 api.wedeploy.xyz
127.0.0.1 git.wedeploy.xyz
```
* To run all tests
```
cd tests
TESTER_EMAIL={useremail} \
TESTER_PW={userpw} \
TEAMUSER_EMAIL={teamemail} \
TEAMUSER_PW={teampw} \
REMOTE=wedeploy.xyz \
./main.exp
```
* To run one test script, i.e. list.exp
```
cd tests
TESTER_EMAIL={useremail} \
TESTER_PW={userpw} \
TEAMUSER_EMAIL={teamemail} \
TEAMUSER_PW={teampw} \
REMOTE=wedeploy.xyz \
./main.exp -tclargs list.exp
```
* TESTER_EMAIL should have at least a standard plan and user will be created if it doesn't already exist.
* For any environment variable not provided, following default values are used:

| Variable       | Default value             |
| -------------  | ------------------------- |
| TEAMUSER_EMAIL | qa.team.user@wedeploy.com |
| TEAMUSER_PW    | L6P&ZExVXydC              |
| TESTER_EMAIL   | cli-tester@test.com       |
| TESTER_PW      | test                      |
| REMOTE         | wedeploy.xyz              |


## Test results
Results are reported in test-results/report.txt.  This contains a list of all scenarios from latest test run.  Any fails and errors encountered are listed below the respective scenario name.

Results are also compiled in junit format in test-results/TEST-report.xml.  

To view test reports on Jenkins CI
1. Click [here](https://ci.wedeploy.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/WeDeploy%2Fcli-functional-tests/activity/).  
1. Click on a test run.
1. For junit report, click 'Tests' in the top nav bar.
1. For report.txt, click 'Artifacts' in the top nav bar, then click functional/test-results/report.txt.

## Contributing
The tests are organized into Features and Scenarios.  A Feature is a test suite, which corresponds to a file in the functional/tests folder.  A Feature can contain one or more Scenarios.  Each Scenario is a test case.

Each Feature must begin with
```
Feature: {feature name}
```
and end with
```
TearDownFeature: {feature name}
```
Similarly, each Scenario must begin with
```
Scenario: {scenario name}
```
and end with
```
TearDownScenario: {scenario name}
```

Each scenario begins with setup steps.  Then the actual test steps are all enclosed within a `while` block.  The test steps are a series of `send` and `expect` commands.  In other words, `send` something to the command line, then `expect` something in the terminal output.  After the test steps are any necessary teardown steps.  Please see any of the test files for examples.
